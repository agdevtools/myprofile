                        <p>In 4 years at Allstate Armand established himself as a key person in the Encompass Target
                           Reporting team. Drawing on his experience in the ETL arena, Armand delivered many new ETLs
                           within time and budget, contributed to many differing projects whilst also improving the quality
                           and performance of existing processes. Armand primarily used Informatica, SQL and Business
                           Objects to provide the Encompass business with the metrics and reporting they needed. Armand
                           also introduced python scripts to alert the team when upstream files were not delivered on time.
                           In addition to this he was able to use python to provide automated testing. This provided great
                           time saving for the team.</p> </div>
